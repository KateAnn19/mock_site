        <h2>Prologue</h2>

        <p class="quote">
          <span>🙂     </span>Before I decided to make a career change to software development, I
          was a teacher. I worked with kids and adults with developmental
          disabilities. I have worked in this field for over seven years. I
          enjoyed the work I was doing, but I couldn’t see myself moving up into
          other positions because I didn’t want to work in crisis management
          every day. For some people, it’s possible, but, for me, it wasn’t.</p> <p>I
          struggle with anxiety, and I knew these crises were only exacerbating
          my anxiety more. I also knew I needed to make more money if I couldn’t
          pursue upward management and do something I enjoyed and that I could
          do for the long-term.</p>

        <p>
          Landing on web development was an unlikely choice. I hadn’t ever done
          coding before, and I thought that I had to be superhuman smart to do
          it. I also didn’t look or act the part. I wasn’t into video games. I
          didn’t stay up to date on the latest technology. I prided myself on
          being a flip phone user for longer than everyone else (so hipster 😃 ).</p>
          <p>Technology was vital to me because I used it, but I wasn’t obsessed.
          So, to be honest, the only reason Web Development was even on the list
          was because of a friend who happens to be a software developer told me
          that I’d make a good developer. I was like, “me?.....Nah”. But he was
          serious. He said that teachers make great developers and that there
          are these programs called Bootcamps, and I should look into them. I
          then asked him like a million questions and did some research and
          realized that I had many misconceptions about web development,
          programming, and software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I realized I don’t have to be superhuman smart, that the field is
          becoming more diverse and accessible and that it’s also not people in
          dark cubicles hiding away from everyone else. It’s fun, interactive,
          full of good people, and, on top of that, there’s a thriving and
          healthy community surrounding it. So I started a Javascript course to
          see if I could hack it, and I’ll be honest that I struggled. I didn’t
          get it at first, but I kept going because I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a
          lot more than I thought I would. I found myself wanting to understand
          everything and wanting to figure things out and couldn’t let things go
          until I got them.</p><p>I leaned heavily on my fiance, who is a hardware
          engineer. He helped me understand the basics and encouraged me to keep
          going. I’m lucky to have him, and everyone needs a champion. But I
          think I still would have pursued this regardless. Still, I am so glad
          he has been there.</p> After completing my Javascript course, I got pretty
          serious about looking into Bootcamps until I finally landed on Lambda
          School. I wanted to choose the right one for me, and Lambda School
          checked off all the boxes. They offer an ISA making it even more
          possible for me to make this career transition. I enrolled and went
          through the program. <p>I had ups and downs, but I kept persevering
          because I wanted to. In the past, I persevered because I had to. This
          time around, I persevered because I was enjoying what I was doing and
          felt inspired. 💃  I also felt like I still had energy and emotion left
          for my partner and family after the day ended, which is very different
          from before. After work most days in my teaching job, I’d be utterly
          exhausted and had nothing left. I’d even cry just out of exhaustion.
          Now I stay up late because I just want that page to look good. It’s
          fun, enjoyable and there’s so much room to grow and learn that I’ll
          never get bored.
