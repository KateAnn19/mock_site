        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p class="quote">
          <span>üôÇ </span>Before I decided to make a career change to software
          development, I was a teacher. I worked with kids and adults with
          developmental disabilities. I have worked in this field for over seven
          years. I enjoyed the work I was doing, but I couldn‚Äôt see myself
          moving up into other positions because I didn‚Äôt want to work in crisis
          management every day. For some people, it‚Äôs possible, but, for me, it
          wasn‚Äôt.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          I struggle with anxiety, and I knew these crises were only
          exacerbating my anxiety more. I also knew I needed to make more money
          if I couldn‚Äôt pursue upward management and do something I enjoyed and
          that I could do for the long-term.
        </p>
        <p>
          Landing on web development was an unlikely choice. I hadn‚Äôt ever done
          coding before, and I thought that I had to be superhuman smart to do
          it. I also didn‚Äôt look or act the part. I wasn‚Äôt into video games. I
          didn‚Äôt stay up to date on the latest technology. I prided myself on
          being a flip phone user for longer than everyone else (so hipster üòÉ
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology was vital to me because I used it, but I wasn‚Äôt obsessed.
          So, to be honest, the only reason Web Development was even on the list
          was because of a friend who happens to be a software developer told me
          that I‚Äôd make a good developer. I was like, ‚Äúme?.....Nah‚Äù. But he was
          serious. He said that teachers make great developers and that there
          are these programs called Bootcamps, and I should look into them. I
          then asked him like a million questions and did some research and
          realized that I had many misconceptions about web development,
          programming, and software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized I don‚Äôt have to be superhuman smart, that the field is
          becoming more diverse and accessible and that it‚Äôs also not people in
          dark cubicles hiding away from everyone else. It‚Äôs fun, interactive,
          full of good people, and, on top of that, there‚Äôs a thriving and
          healthy community surrounding it. So I started a Javascript course to
          see if I could hack it, and I‚Äôll be honest that I struggled. I didn‚Äôt
          get it at first, but I kept going because I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a
          lot more than I thought I would. I found myself wanting to understand
          everything and wanting to figure things out and couldn‚Äôt let things go
          until I got them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned heavily on my fiance, who is a hardware engineer. He helped
          me understand the basics and encouraged me to keep going. I‚Äôm lucky to
          have him, and everyone needs a champion. But I think I still would
          have pursued this regardless. Still, I am so glad he has been there.
        </p>{" "}
        After completing my Javascript course, I got pretty serious about
        looking into Bootcamps until I finally landed on Lambda School. I wanted
        to choose the right one for me, and Lambda School checked off all the
        boxes. They offer an ISA making it even more possible for me to make
        this career transition. I enrolled and went through the program.{" "}
        <p>
          I had ups and downs, but I kept persevering because I wanted to. In
          the past, I persevered because I had to. This time around, I
          persevered because I was enjoying what I was doing and felt inspired.
          üíÉ I also felt like I still had energy and emotion left for my partner
          and family after the day ended, which is very different from before.
          After work most days in my teaching job, I‚Äôd be utterly exhausted and
          had nothing left. I‚Äôd even cry just out of exhaustion. Now I stay up
          late because I just want that page to look good. It‚Äôs fun, enjoyable
          and there‚Äôs so much room to grow and learn that I‚Äôll never get bored.
